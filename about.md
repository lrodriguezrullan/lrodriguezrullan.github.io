I am a software engineer at [Tempus Nova LLC](http://tempusnova.com), a Google Cloud Premier Partner based in Denver, Colorado. I develop enterprise applications for our clients using the Google Cloud Platform, Java, and Angular. I have worked in the software development and system administration fields since 1989. I live outside Denver, Colorado, with my wife and two children. 

## Experience
I got my first software development job during my sophomore year in college. I worked part time at [Spectron](http://www.spectron-msim.com), an oil analysis laboratory, maintaining their [Mechanical Systems Integrity Management (MSIM)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09208119408964780) software using [Rocky Mountain BASIC on HP 9000 Series 200/300 computers](http://hpmemoryproject.org/technics/bench/3048/config_soft_01.htm).

When I graduated college I began working full-time at Spectron. I worked on migrating the MSIM software to Windows using C/C++, Delphi, Watcom SQL, and MS SQL Server. They gave me the opportunity to travel to [Tembagapura, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tembagapura), to install the MSIM system on a remote mine.

After six years at Spectron, I went to work with the Office of Management and Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico (OMB). I started as a Programming and Communication Systems Consultant, working with the agency's Lotus Notes mail servers, Web site, and firewall. After about a year, I was promoted to Information Systems Operations Manager and put in charge of the operation of the IT infrastructure of the agency, including the government WAN.

After three and a half years at OMB, I partnered with a few friends to start T-30, an IT consulting firm. I worked at T-30 for about a year before to going to work with Softek as a contract Senior Systems Analyst for several clients, including Puerto Rico Telephone and the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund Corporation. Most of my work at Softek was developing and maintaining intranet applications using Lotus Domino, Java, JDBC, and Oracle PL/SQL.

After almost 5 years at Softek, I decided to take a year off work to complete my last year of Law School. Shortly after (successfully!) taking the bar exam, I returned to Puerto Rico Telephone (now Claro), first as an Independent Contractor and later as an employee of Line-of-Sight, Inc. I continued to work with Lotus Domino, Java, JDBC, and Oracle PL/SQL, but also developed and maintained several applications using Spring Framework, Hibernate, and jQuery.

After five years at Line-of-Sight, I started working in Tempus Nova, first as Lotus Notes developer, but shortly after as software engineer using Java, Angular, and some Python and Go.

## Education
I hold a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from the [University of Puerto Rico, Bayamón Campus](https://www.uprb.edu) and a Juris Doctor from the [University of Puerto Rico, School of Law](http://derecho.uprrp.edu). In law school I focused on topics related to entrepreneurship, participating in the Cyber Law Section of the Legal Aid Clinic and taking courses in Digital Music, Technology Law, and Partnerships and Corporations Law. I also took an additional 25 undergraduate and 9 graduate credits in Applied Mathematics and Data Structures at the [University of Puerto Rico, College of Natural Sciences](https://math.uprrp.edu).

## Certifications
I hold the following certifications: Google Certified Professional - Cloud Architect, IBM Certified Application Developer – Lotus Notes and Domino 6/6.5, and IBM Certified Lotus Professional Domino R5 Application Developer.
